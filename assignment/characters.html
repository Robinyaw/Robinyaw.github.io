            <h1>Characters</h1>
            <p>Many of the characters from the Mario series
                were introduced in this game, though two
                of the characters went under different names
                then what they are known as today. Princess Toadstool,
                now known as Princess Peach (as she always was in Japan),
                King Koopa, now known as Bowser, and the Mushroom People/Retainers,
                now known as Toads, were all introduced in Super Mario Bros. Various
                famous enemies were also first found in this game, such as the Goombas,
                Koopa Troopas, Piranha Plants, Bullet Bills, Cheep-Cheep, and others. Mario
                and Luigi, who were introduced in Donkey Kong and Mario Bros., respectively,
                were both introduced in this game.
