            <h1>Characters</h1>
            <p>Many of the characters from the Mario series<br>
                were introduced in this game, though two of the characters went<br>
                under different names then what they are known as today.<br>
                Princess Toadstool, now known as Princess Peach (as she<br>
                always was in Japan), King Koopa, now known as Bowser,<br>
                and the Mushroom People/Retainers, now known as Toads,<br>
                were all introduced in Super Mario Bros. Various famous<br>
                enemies were also first found in this game, such as the<br>
                Goombas, Koopa Troopas, Piranha Plants, Bullet Bills,<br>
                Cheep-Cheep, and others. Mario and Luigi, who were<br>
                introduced in Donkey Kong and Mario Bros., respectively,<br>
                were both introduced in this game.

                    alternating between them, trying to finish<br>
                    the game that way. The only difference<br>
                    between Mario and Luigi are a change in<br>
                    the color of their clothes. There are no<br>
