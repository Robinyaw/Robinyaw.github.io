            <h1>Characters</h1>
            <p>Many of the characters from the Mario series were
                introduced in this game, though two of the characters went
                under different names then what they are known as today.
                Princess Toadstool, now known as Princess Peach (as she
                always was in Japan), King Koopa, now known as Bowser,
                and the Mushroom People/Retainers, now known as Toads,
                were all introduced in Super Mario Bros. Various famous
                enemies were also first found in this game, such as the
                Goombas, Koopa Troopas, Piranha Plants, Bullet Bills,
                Cheep-Cheep, and others. Mario and Luigi, who were
                introduced in Donkey Kong and Mario Bros, respectively,
                were both introduced in this game.</p>

                    his appearance has been slightly change
                    and he has gained various new powers.
                    He is a playable character.

                    portion of the game, which has players
                    alternating between them, trying to finish
                    the game that way. The only difference
                    between Mario and Luigi are a change in
                    the color of their clothes. There are no
                    gameplay difference between two. He is
                    pratically neglected as the does not appear
                    in game art or the manual.
