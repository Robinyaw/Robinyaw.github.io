                <p>One day the kingdom of the peaceful mushroom people
                    was invaded by the Koopa, a tribe of turtles famous for
                    their black magic. The quiet, peace-loving Mushroom
                    People were turned into mere stones, bricks and even
                    field horsehair plants, and the Mushroom Kingdom fell
                    into ruin. The only one who can undo the magic spell on
                    the Mushroom People and return them to their normal
                    selves is the Princess Toadstool, the daughter of the
                    Mushroom King. Unfortunately, she is presently in the
                    hands of the great Koopa turtle king. Mario, the hero of
                    the story hears about the Mushroom People's plight
                    and sets out on a quest to free the Mushroom Princess
                    from the evil Koopa and restore the fallen kingdom of
                    the Mushroom People. You are Mario! It's up to you to
                    save the Mushroom People from the black magic of the
                    Koopa!
